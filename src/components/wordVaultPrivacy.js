<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
  This privacy policy applies to the Word Vault app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Arun Guruswamy (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
</p>
<br />
<strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
<p>
  <strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> The Application allows you to manually input and store words or phrases ("User Content") directly on your device. Registration is not required to use the core storage functionality of the Application.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information for Enhanced Features (Gemini API):</strong> To provide enhanced features, such as definitions, usage examples, translations, or other relevant information about the words or phrases you have saved, the Application utilizes the Google Gemini API. When you specifically choose to use such a feature for a particular word or phrase, that specific <strong>User Content (the word or phrase)</strong> is sent to the Google Gemini API for processing. This is done solely to generate the requested information and display it back to you within the Application.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No Automatic Data Collection:</strong> The Application does not automatically collect any other personally identifiable information from you or your device when you download or use it.
</p>
<br />
<strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong>
<p>
  This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.
</p>
<br />
<strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
<p>
  <strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Yes. As described above, when you use features that require fetching additional information about your stored words or phrases, that specific User Content is sent to Google to be processed by the Gemini API. Google's handling of this data is governed by their own API Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Service Provider strongly encourages you to review Google's policies:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google APIs Terms of Service</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> Other than sending User Content to the Google Gemini API upon your explicit action as described, the Service Provider does not share any of your information or User Content with any other third parties.
</p>
<br />
<strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
<p>
  <strong>General Data Collection:</strong> You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Gemini API Feature Usage:</strong> You can choose not to use the specific features within the Application that rely on the Google Gemini API. If you do not use these features, your User Content will not be sent to Google.
</p>
<br />
<strong>Children</strong>
<p>
  The Application is not designed for or intentionally targeted at children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold depending on the country, e.g., 16 in the EEA/UK). The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under these age limits.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (arunguruswamy22@gmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age (or the applicable age in your country) to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
</p>
<br />
<strong>Security</strong>
<p>
  The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. User Content (your saved words and phrases) is stored locally on your device. When User Content is sent to the Google Gemini API, the transmission typically occurs over secure protocols (like HTTPS). However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While the Service Provider takes reasonable precautions, they cannot guarantee absolute security. The security of data processed by Google via the Gemini API is subject to Google's security practices.
</p>
<br />
<strong>Changes</strong>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason, including changes in how the Application functions or interacts with third-party services like the Google Gemini API. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
</p>
<br />
<p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-04-07</p> 
<br />
<strong>Your Consent</strong>
<p>
  By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider. This includes your consent to store User Content locally on your device and, <strong>if you choose to use the relevant features, your consent to send specific User Content (words or phrases) to the Google Gemini API for processing as described herein.</strong>
